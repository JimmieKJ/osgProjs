osgRecipes
=============

The osgRecipes project includes different recipes written with OpenSceneGraph (OSG) and can help developers work with this famous 3D rendering engine, as well as other auxiliary libraries. The osgRecipes project itself is in the Public Domain, but some of its recipes may be under other licenses.

This project is also the source code repository of Rui Wang & Xuelei Qian's book `OpenSceneGraph 3.0 Cookbook`, Packt Publishing, 2012. You may read more details or order this book at: http://www.packtpub.com/openscenegrap-3-for-advanced-3d-programming-using-api-cookbook/book

------------
Installation
------------

1. Use CMake (or cmake-gui) to build makefiles or solutions of the recipes
# cmake <recipe_dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir>

2. Run 'make' to build and install all recipes
# make
# make install

4. Copy data files from both cookbook and integrations into the binary directory.
# cp <recipe_dir>/cookbook/data/*.* <install_dir>/bin
# cp -r <recipe_dir>/integrations/data <install_dir>/bin

5. Have fun!

Integrations
------------

This section will show you how to integrate OSG with different kinds of libraries and SDKs. These libraries can add extra functionalities like special effects, visual components and interaction methods to your OSG scene and greatly improve the performance of the applications. These libraries must be free for downloading and for non-commercial purpose of use. The license of the example code may vary according to the license of the third-party library if it does not fit the public domain.
